## Project Background

The "Rhino Poaching in South Africa" project is a data visualization study that examines the alarming rise in rhino poaching incidents across South Africa between 2006 and 2016. This project aims to raise awareness about wildlife conservation challenges and highlight the severity of the poaching crisis that threatens the survival of these endangered species.

## Project Features

- Temporal analysis of poaching incidents over a decade
- Geographic distribution of poaching hotspots across South African provinces
- Comparison of poaching rates in different national parks and reserves
- Correlation between anti-poaching efforts and incident rates
- Visualization of conservation status and population decline

## Technical Implementation

Created with Tableau, this visualization dashboard combines various chart types including time series, maps, and comparative analyses to present a comprehensive picture of the rhino poaching crisis. The project employs thoughtful color schemes that reflect the serious nature of the subject matter while maintaining clarity in data presentation. Interactive elements allow users to explore specific time periods, regions, and conservation areas to better understand the patterns and scale of this environmental challenge. Through effective data storytelling, the visualization aims to support conservation advocacy and inform policy discussions around wildlife protection.
